# Minimum Absolute Difference In BST

> Difficulty: `Medium`

> Points: **4**

Given a binary search tree having **n (n>1)**  nodes, the task is to find the minimum absolute difference between any two nodes.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Input tree

**Output:**

10

**Explanation:**

There are no two nodes whose absolute difference is smaller than 10.


**Example 2:**

**Input:**

Input tree

**Output:**

20

**Explanation:**

There are no two nodes whose absolute difference is smaller than 20.


**Your Task:**
You don't have to take any input. Just complete the function **absolute\_diff** **() ,** that takes root as input and return minimum absolute difference between any two nodes.

**Expected Time Complexity:**  O(n)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:**  O(Height of tree)

**Constraints:** 2 <= n <= 10<sup>5<br></sup>0 <= Node->data <= 10<sup>9</sup>

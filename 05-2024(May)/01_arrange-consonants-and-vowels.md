# Arrange Consonants and Vowels

> Difficulty: `Medium`

> Points: **4**

Given a singly linked list having **n**  nodes containing english alphabets **('a'-'z')** . Rearrange the linked list in such a way that all the vowels come before the consonants while maintaining the **order of their arrival** .

**Example 1:**

**Input:<br />** n = 9<br />linked list: a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i <br />**Output:**  <br />a -> e -> i -> b -> c -> d -> f -> g -> h<br />**Explanation:**  <br />After rearranging the input linked list according to the condition the resultant linked list will be as shown in output.

**Example 2:**

**Input:<br />** n = 8<br />linked list: a -> b -> a -> b -> d -> e -> e -> d <br />**Output:**  <br />a -> a -> e -> e -> b -> b -> d -> d<br />**Explanation:**  <br />After rearranging the input linked list according to the condition the resultant linked list will be as shown in output.

**Your Task:** <br />Your task is to complete the function **arrangeCV()** , which takes **head**  of linked list and arranges the list in such a way that all the vowels come before the consonants while maintaining the **order of their arrival** and returns the head of the updated linked list.

**Expected Time Complexity :**  **** O(n)<br />**Expected Auxiliary Space :** O(1)

**Constraints:** <br />1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup><br />'a' <= elements of linked list <= 'z'

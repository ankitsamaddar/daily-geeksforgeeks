# Party of Couples

> Difficulty: `Easy`

> Points: **2**

You are given an integer array **arr[]**  of size **n,**  representing n number of people in a party, each person is denoted by an integer. Couples are represented by the **same number** ie: **two**  people have the **same integer value** , it means they are a **couple** . Find out the **only**  **single person**  in the party of couples.

**NOTE:** It is guarantee that there exist only one single person in the party.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  <br />n = 5<br /> arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}<br /> **Output:**  <br />3<br /> **Explaination:**  Only the number 3 is single.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**  <br />n = 11 <br />arr = {1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 6} <br />**Output: <br />** 4 <br />**Explaination:**  4 is the only single.

**Your Task:** <br />You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function **findSingle()**  which takes the size of the array **n**  and the array **arr[]**  as input parameters and returns the only single person.

**Expected Time Complexity:**  O(n)<br />**Expected Auxiliary Space:**  O(1)

**Constraints:** <br />1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>4</sup><br />1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>
